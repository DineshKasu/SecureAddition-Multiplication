0


Party 0 has value 1
Party 1 has value 0


Party 0 sends the random share 1 to party 1
Party 0 keeps 0 as the corresponding partial share
Party 1 sends the random share 1 to party 0
Party 1 keeps 1 as the corresponding partial share


a1=0
a2=1
b1=1
b2=1
(a1 + a2)*(b1 + b2) = (0 + 1)*(1 + 1) =0


Party 1 generates four public keys and keeps the corresponding secret key for 3
Party 0 generates r = 1
row 0 = (0 + 0)*(1 + 0) +1 = 1
row 1 = (0 + 0)*(1 + 1) +1 = 1
row 2 = (0 + 1)*(1 + 0) +1 = 0
row 3 = (0 + 1)*(1 + 1) +1 = 1
Party 1 decrypts row 3 of the table and gets the value 1


Party 0 shares its partial result (1) with Party 1
Party 1 shares its partial result (1) with Party 0
AND is 0
