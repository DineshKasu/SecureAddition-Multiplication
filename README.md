# SecureAddition-Multiplication
Implementing the Secure Addition &amp; Multiplication using Distributed Algorithm to preserve the privacy of Data Mining

Implement secure addition and multiplication

For the addition case, you should handle addition of positive numbers across any number of parties, each of which holds a single value

For the multiplication case, you should handle multiplication of single bits across two parties
